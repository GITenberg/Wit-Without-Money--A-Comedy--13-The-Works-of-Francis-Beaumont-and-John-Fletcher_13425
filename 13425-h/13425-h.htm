<i>Actus primus. Scena prima.</i>

<hr>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Uncle <i>and</i> Merchant.
</p>
<p>
<i>Merc.</i> When saw you <i>Valentine</i>?
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> Not since the Horse-race, he's taken up with those that
woo the Widow.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> How can he live by snatches from such people? he bore a
worthy mind.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> Alas, he's sunk, his means are gone, he wants, and which
is worse,<br>
Takes a delight in doing so.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 147]</span>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> That's strange.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Runs Lunatick, if you but talk of states, he cannot be
brought (now he has spent his own) to think there's inheritance, or
means, but all a common riches, all men bound to be his Bailiffs.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> This is something dangerous.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> No Gentleman that has estate to use it in keeping house,
or followers, for those wayes he cries against, for Eating sins, dull
Surfeits, cramming of Serving-men, mustering of Beggars, maintaining
Hospitals for Kites, and Curs, grounding their fat faiths upon old
Country proverbs, God bless the Founders; these he would have ventured
into more manly uses, Wit, and carriage, and never thinks of state, or
means, the ground-works: holding it monstrous, men should feed their
bodies, and starve their understandings.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> That's most certain.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> Yes, if he could stay there.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> Why let him marry, and that way rise again.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> It's most impossible, he will not look with any
handsomeness upon a Woman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> Is he so strange to Women?
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> I know not what it is, a foolish glory he has got, I know
not where, to balk those benefits, and yet he will converse and flatter
'em, make 'em, or fair, or foul, rugged, or smooth, as his impression
serves, for he affirms, they are only lumps, and undigested pieces,
lickt over to a form by our affections, and then they show. The Lovers
let 'em pass.
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Fountain, Bellamore, Hairbrain.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> He might be one, he carries as much promise; they are wondrous
merry.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> O their hopes are high, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> Is <i>Valentine</i> come to Town?
</p>
<p>
<i>Bella.</i> Last night, I heard.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> We miss him monstrously in our directions, for this Widow
is as stately, and as crafty, and stands I warrant you&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Hair.</i> Let her stand sure, she falls before us else, come let's go
seek <i>Valentine</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> This Widow seems a Gallant.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 148]</span>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> A goodly Woman, and to her handsomness she bears her
state, reserved, and great Fortune has made her Mistress of a full
means, and well she knows to use it.
</p>
<p>
<i>M[e]r.</i> I would <i>Valentine</i> had her.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> There's no hope of that, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> O' that condition, he had his Mortgage in again.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> I would he had.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> Seek means, and see what I'le do, however let the Money be
paid in, I never sought a Gentlemans undoing, nor eat the bread of other
mens vexations, you told me of another Brother.
</p>
<p>
<i>Uncle.</i> Yes Sir, more miserable than he, for he has eat him, and
drunk him up, a handsome Gentleman, and fine Scholar.
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter three</i> Tenants.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> What are these?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> The Tenants, they'll do what they can.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> It is well prepared, be earnest, honest friends, and loud
upon him, he is deaf to his own good.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> We mean to tell him part of our minds an't please you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> Do, and do it home, and in what my care may help, or my
perswasions when we meet next.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Do but perswade him fairly; and for your money, mine, and
these mens thanks too, and what we can be able.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mer.</i> Y'are most honest, you shall find me no less, and so I leave
you, prosper your business my friends.
<span class="stage">[<i>Ex.</i> Mer.</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Pray Heaven it may, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Nay if he will be mad, I'le be mad with him, and tell him
that I'le not spare him, his Father kept good Meat, good Drink, good
Fellows, good Hawks, good Hounds, and bid his Neighbours welcome; kept
him too, and supplied his prodigality, yet kept his state still; must
we turn Tenants now, after we have lived under the race of Gentry, and
maintained good Yeomantry, to some of the City, to a great shoulder of
Mutton and a Custard, and have our state turned into Cabbidge Gardens,
must it be so?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> You must be milder to him.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> That's as he makes his game.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 149]</span>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Intreat him lovingly, and make him feel.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> I'le pinch him to the bones else.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Valen.</i> <i>Within</i>.] And tell the Gentleman, I'le be with him presently,
say I want money too, I must not fail boy.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> You'l want Cloaths, I hope.
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Valentine.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Bid the young Courtier repair to me anon, I'le read to him.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> He comes, [b]e diligent, but not too rugged, start him, but
affright him not.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Phew, are you there?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> We come to see you Nephew, be not angry.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Why do you dog me thus, with these strange people? why, all
the world shall never make me rich more, nor master of these troubles.
</p>
<p>
<i>Tenants.</i> We beseech you for our poor Childrens sake.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Who bid you get 'em? have you not threshing work enough, but
Children must be bang'd out o'th' sheaf too? other men with all their
delicates, and healthful diets, can get but wind eggs: you with a clove
of Garlick, a piece of Cheese would break a Saw, and sowre Milk, can
mount like Stallions, and I must maintain these tumblers.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> You ought to maintain us, we have maintained you, and when
you slept provided for you; who bought the Silk you wear? I think our
labours; reckon, you'll find it so: who found your Horses perpetual
pots of Ale, maintain'd your Taverns, and who extol'd you in the
Half-crown-boxes, where you might sit and muster all the Beauties?
we had no hand in these; no, we are all puppies? Your Tenants base
vexations.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Very well, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Had you Land, Sir, and honest men to serve your purposes,
honest and faithful, and will you run away from 'em, betray your self,
and your poor Tribe to misery; mortgage all us, like old Cloaks; where
will you hunt next? you had a thousand Acres, fair and open: The
Kings-Bench is enclos'd, there's no good riding, the Counter is full
of thorns and brakes, take heed Sir, and boggs, you'l quickly find what
broth they're made of.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 150]</span>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Y'are short and pithy.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> They say y'are a fine Gentleman, and of excellent
judgement, they report you have a wit; keep your self out o'th' Rain,
and take your Cloak with you, which by interpretation is your State,
Sir, or I shall think your fame belied you, you have money, and may
have means.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I prethee leave prating, does my good lye within thy brain
to further, or my undoing in thy pity? go, go, get you home, there
whistle to your Horses, and let them edifie; away, sow Hemp to hang your
selves withal: what am I to you, or you to me; am I your Landlord,
puppies?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> This is uncivil.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> More unmerciful you, to vex me with these Bacon
Broth and Puddings, they are the walking shapes of all my
sorrows.
</p>
<p>
<i>3 Tenants.</i> Your Fathers Worship would have used us better.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> My Fathers Worship was a Fool.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Hey, hey boys, old <i>Valentine</i> i'faith, the old boy still.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Fie Cousin.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I mean besotted to his state, he had never left me the
misery of so much means else, which till I sold, was a meer meagrim to
me: If you will talk, turn out these Tenants, they are as killing to my
nature Uncle, as water to a Feaver.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> We will go, but it is like Rams, to come again the
stronger, and you shall keep your state.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Thou lyest, I will not.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Sweet Sir, thou lyest, thou shalt, and so good morrow.
<span class="stage">[<i>Exeunt</i> Tenants.</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> This was my man, and of a noble breeding: now to your
business Uncle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> To your state then.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> 'Tis gone, and I am glad on't, name it no more, 'tis that
I pray against, and Heaven has heard me, I tell you, Sir, I am more
fearful of it, I mean, of thinking of more lands, or livings, than
sickly men are travelling o' Sundays, for being quell'd with Carriers;
out upon't, <i>caveat emptor</i>, let the fool out-sweat it, that thinks
he has got a catch on't.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> This is madness to be a wilful begger.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 151]</span>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I am mad then, and so I mean to be, will that content you?
How bravely now I live, how jocund, how near the first inheritance,
without fears, how free from title-troubles!
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> And from means too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Means? why all good men's my means; my wit's my Plow, the
Town's my stock, Tavern's my standing-house, and all the world knows
there's no want; all Gentlemen that love Society, love me; all Purses
that wit and pleasure opens, are my Tenants; every mans Cloaths fit me,
the next fair lodging is but my next remove, and when I please to be
more eminent, and take the Air, a piece is levied, and a Coach prepared,
and I go I care not whither, what need state here?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> But say these means were honest, will they last, Sir?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Far longer than your jerkin, and wear fairer, should I take
ought of you, 'tis true, I beg'd now, or which is worse than that, I
stole a kindness, and which is worst of all, I lost my way in't; your
mind's enclosed, nothing lies open nobly, your very thoughts are Hinds
that work on nothing but daily sweat and trouble: were my way so full of
dirt as this, 'tis true I'd shift it; are my acquaintance Grasiers? but
Sir, know, no man that I am allied to, in my living, but makes it equal,
whether his own use, or my necessity pull first, nor is this forc'd, but
the meer quality and poisure of goodness, and do you think I venture
nothing equal?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> You pose me Cousin.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> What's my knowledge Uncle, is't not worth mony? what's my
understanding, travel, reading, wit, all these digested, my daily making
men, some to speak, that too much flegm had frozen up, some that spoke
too much, to hold their peace, and put their tongues to pensions, some
to wear their cloaths, and some to keep 'em, these are nothing Uncle;
besides these wayes, to teach the way of nature, a manly love, community
to all that are deservers, not examining how much, or what's done for
them, 'tis wicked, and such a one like you, chews his thoughts [double],
making 'em only food for his repentance.
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter two</i> Servants.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Ser.</i> This cloak and hat Sir, and my Masters love.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Commend's to thy Master, and take that, and leave 'em at my
lodging.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 152]</span>
<p>
<i>1 Ser.</i> I shall do it Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I do not think of these things.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Ser.</i> Please you Sir, I have gold here for you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Give it me, drink that and commend me to thy Master; look
you Uncle, do I beg these?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> No sure, 'tis your worth, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> 'Tis like enough, but pray satisfie me, are not these ways
as honest as persecuting the starved inheritance, with musty Corn, the
very rats were fain to run away from, or felling rotten wood by the
pound, like spices, which Gentlemen do after burn by th' ounces? do not
I know your way of feeding beasts with grains, and windy stuff, to blow
up Butchers? your racking Pastures, that have eaten up as many singing
Shepherds, and their issues, as <i>Andeluzia</i> breeds? these are
authentique, I tell you Sir, I would not change ways with you, unless it
were to sell your state that hour, and if it were possible to spend it
then too, for all your Beans in <i>Rumnillo</i>, now you know me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> I would you knew your self, but since you are grown such a
strange enemy to all that fits you, give me leave to make your Brothers
fortune.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> How?
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> From your mortgage, which yet you may recover, I'le find the
means.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Pray save your labour Sir, my Brother and my self will run
one fortune, and I think what I hold a meer vexation, cannot be safe
for him, I love him better, he has wit at will, the world has means,
he shall live without this trick of state, we are heirs both, and all
the world before us.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> My last offer, and then I am gone.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> What is't, and then I'le answer.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> What think you of a wife yet to restore you, and tell me
seriously without these trifles.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> And you can find one, that can please my fancy, you shall
not find me stubborn.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Speak your Woman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> One without eyes, that is, self commendations, for when they
find they are handsom, they are unwholsome; one without ears, not giving
time to flatterers, for she that hears her self commended, wavers, and
points men out a way to make
<span class="pagenum">[p 153]</span>
'em wicked; one without substance of her
self; that woman without the pleasure of her life, that's wanton; though
she be young, forgetting it, though fair, making her glass the eyes of
honest men, not her own admiration, all her ends obedience, all her
hours new blessings, if there may be such a woman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> Yes there may be.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> And without state too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> You are disposed to trifle, well, fare you well Sir, when
you want me next, you'l seek me out a better sence.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Farewell Uncle, and as you love your estate, let not me hear
on't.<span class="stage">[<i>Exit.</i></span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Unc.</i> It shall not trouble you, I'le watch him still,<br>
And when his friends fall off then bend his will.<span class="stage">[<i>Exit.</i></span>
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Isabella, <i>and</i> Luce.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> I know the cause of all this sadness now, your sister has
ingrost all the brave Lovers.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> She has wherewithall, much good may't do her, prethee speak
softly, we are open to mens ears.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Fear not, we are safe, we may see all that pass, hear all,
and make our selves merry with their language, and yet stand
undiscovered, be not melancholy, you are as fair as she.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> Who I? I thank you, I am as haste ordain'd me, a thing
slubber'd, my sister is a goodly portly Lady, a woman of a presence, she
spreads sattens, as the Kings ships do canvas every where, she may spare
me her misen, and her bonnets, strike her main Petticoat, and yet
outsail me, I am a Carvel to her.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> But a tight one.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> She is excellent, well built too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> And yet she's old.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> She never saw above one voyage <i>Luce</i>, and credit me
after another, her Hull will serve again, a right good Merchant: she
plaies, and sings too, dances and discourses, comes very near Essays, a
pretty Poet, begins to piddle with Philosophic, a subtil Chymick Wench,
and can extract the Spirit of mens Estates, she has the light before
her, and cannot miss her choice for me, 'tis reason I wait my mean
fortune.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> You are so bashfull.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> It is not at first word up and ride, thou art cozen'd,
<span class="pagenum">[p 154]</span>
that would shew mad i' faith: besides, we lose the main part of our
politick government: if we become provokers, then we are fair, and fit
for mens imbraces, when like towns, they lie before us ages, yet not
carried, hold out their strongest batteries, then compound too without
the loss of honour, and march off with our fair wedding, Colours flying.
Who are these?
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Franc, <i>and</i> Lance.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> I know not, nor I care not.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> Prethee peace then, a well built Gentleman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> But poorly thatcht.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Has he devour'd you too?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> H'as gulp'd me down <i>Lance</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Left you no means to study?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Not a farthing: dispatcht my poor annuity I thank him,
here's all the hope I have left, one bare ten shillings.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> You are fit for great mens services.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> I am fit, but who'le take me thus? mens miseries are now
accounted stains in their natures. I have travelled, and I have studied
long, observed all Kingdoms, know all the promises of Art and manners,
yet that I am not bold, nor cannot flatter, I shall not thrive, all
these are but vain Studies, art thou so rich as to get me a lodging
<i>Lance</i>?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> I'le sell the titles of my house else, my Horse, my Hawk,
nay's death I'le pawn my wife: Oh Mr. <i>Francis</i>, that I should see
your Fathers house fall thus!
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> An honest fellow.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> Your Fathers house, that fed me, that bred up all my name!
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> A gratefull fellow.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> And fall by&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Peace, I know you are angry <i>Lance</i>, but I must not
hear with whom, he is my Brother, and though you hold him slight, my
most dear Brother: A Gentleman, excepting some few rubs, he were too
excellent to live here else, fraughted as deep with noble and brave
parts, the issues of a noble and manly Spirit, as any he alive. I must
not hear you; though I am miserable, and he made me so, yet still he
is my Brother, still I love him, and to that tye of blood link my
affections.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> A noble nature! dost thou know him <i>Luce</i>?
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 155]</span>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> No, Mistress.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> Thou shouldest ever know such good men, what a fair body
and mind are married! did he not say he wanted?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> What's that to you?
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> 'Tis true, but 'tis great pity.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> How she changes! ten thousand more than he, as handsom men too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> 'Tis like enough, but as I live, this Gentleman among ten
thousand thousand! is there no knowing him? why should he want? fellows
of no merit, slight and puft souls, that walk like shadows, by leaving
no print of what they are, or poise, let them complain.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Her colour changes strangely.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> This man was made, to mark his wants to waken us; alas poor
Gentleman, but will that keep him from cold and hunger, believe me he is
well bred, and cannot be but of a noble linage, mark him, mark him well.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> 'Is a handsom man.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> The sweetness of his sufferance sets him off, O <i>Luce</i>, but
whither go I?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> You cannot hide it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> I would he had what I can spare.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> 'Tis charitable.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lance.</i> Come Sir, I'le see you lodg'd, you have tied my tongue
fast, I'le steal before you want, 'tis but a hanging.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> That's a good fellow too, an honest fellow, why, this would
move a stone, I must needs know; but that some other time.
<span class="stage">[<i>Exit</i> Lance, <i>and</i> Franc.</span>

<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Is the wind there? that makes for me.
</p>
<p>

<i>Actus</i> [<i>Secundus</i>]. <i>Scena Prima.</i>
</h2>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Widow, <i>and</i> Luce.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> My sister, and a woman of so base a pity! what was the
fellow?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce,</i> Why, an ordinary man, Madam.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Poor?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Poor enough, and no man knows from whence neither.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 156]</span>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> What could she see?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Only his misery, for else she might behold a hundred handsomer.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Did she change much?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Extreamly, when he spoke, and then her pity, like an
Orator, I fear her love framed such a commendation, and followed it so
far, as made me wonder.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Is she so hot, or such a want of lovers, that she must doat
upon afflictions? why does she not go romage all the prisons, and there
bestow her youth, bewray her wantonness, and flie her honour, common
both to beggery: did she speak to him?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> No, he saw us not, but ever since, she hath been mainly
troubled.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Was he young?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Yes, young enough.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> And looked he like a Gentleman?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Like such a Gentleman, that would pawn ten oaths for twelve
pence.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> My sister, and sink basely! this must not be, does she use
means to know him?
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Yes Madam, and has employed a Squire called <i>Shorthose</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> O that's a precious Knave: keep all this private, but still
be near her lodging: <i>Luce</i>, what you can gather by any means, let
me understand: I'le stop her heat, and turn her charity another way, to
bless her self first; be still close to her counsels; a begger and a
stranger! there's a bless'dness! I'le none of that; I have a toy yet,
sister, shall tell you this is foul, and make you find it, and for your
pains take you the last gown I wore; this makes me mad, but I shall
force a remedy.
</p>
<p class="stage-center">
<i>Enter</i> Fountain, Bellamore, Harebrain, Valentine.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> Sirra, we have so lookt for thee, and long'd for thee;
this widow is the strangest thing, the stateliest, and stands so much
upon her excellencies.
</p>
<p>
<i>Bel.</i> She hath put us off, this month now, for an answer.
</p>
<p>
<i>Hare.</i> No man must visit her, nor look upon her, no, not say, good
morrow, nor good even, till that's past.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 157]</span>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> She has found what dough you are made of, and so kneads you:
are you good at nothing, but these after-games? I have told you often
enough what things they are, what precious things, these widows&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Hare.</i> If we had 'em.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Why the Devil has not craft enough to wooe 'em, there be three
kinds of fools, mark this note Gentlemen, mark it, and understand it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> Well, go forward.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val</i> An Innocent, a knave fool, a fool politick: the last of which
are lovers, widow lovers.
</p>
<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Will you allow no fortune?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> No such blind one.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> We gave you reasons, why 'twas needful for us.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> As you are those fools, I did allow those reasons, but as my
Scholars and companions damn'd 'em: do you know what it is to wooe a
widow? answer me coolely now, and understandingly.
</p>
<p>
<i>Hare.</i> Why to lie with her, and to enjoy her wealth.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Why there you are fools still, crafty to catch your selves,
pure politick fools, I lookt for such an answer; once more hear me, it
is, to wed a widow, to be doubted mainly, whether the state you have be
yours or no, or those old boots you ride in. Mark me, widows are long
extents in Law upon news, livings upon their bodies winding-sheets, they
that enjoy 'em, lie but with dead mens monuments, and beget only their
own ill Epitaphs: Is not this plain now?
</p>
<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Plain spoken.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> And plain truth; but if you'le needs do things of danger, do
but lose your selves, not any part concerns your understandings, for
then you are Meacocks, fools, and miserable march off amain, within an
inch of a Fircug, turn me o'th' toe like a Weather-cock, kill every day
a Sergeant for a twelve month, rob the Exchequer, and burn all the
Rolls, and these will make a shew.
</p>
<p>
<i>Hare.</i> And these are trifles.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Considered to a Widow, empty nothings, for here you venture
but your persons, there the varnish of your persons, your discretions;
why 'tis a monstrous thing to marry at all, especially as now 'tis made;
me thinks a man, an
<span class="pagenum">[p 158]</span>
understanding man, is more wise to me, and of a
nobler tie, than all these trinkets; what do we get by women, but our
senses, which is the rankest part about us, satisfied, and when that's
done, what are we? Crest-fallen Cowards. What benefit can children be,
but charges and disobedience? What's the love they render at one and
twenty years? I pray die Father: when they are young, they are like
bells rung backwards, nothing but noise and giddiness; and come to years
once, there drops a son by th' sword in his Mistresses quarrel, a great
joy to his parents: A Daughter ripe too, grows high and lusty in her
blood, must have a heating, runs away with a supple ham'd Servingman:
his twenty Nobles spent, takes to a trade, and learns to spin mens hair
off; there's another, and most are of this nature, will you marry?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> For my part yes, for any doubt I feel yet.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> And this same widow?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> If I may, and me thinks, however you are pleased to
dispute these dangers, such a warm match, and for you, Sir, were not
hurtfull.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Not half so killing as for you, for me she cannot with all
the Art she has, make me more miserable, or much more fortunate, I have
no state left, a benefit that none of you can brag of, and there's the
Antidote against a Widow, nothing to lose, but that my soul inherits,
which she can neither law nor claw away; to that, but little flesh, it
were too much else; and that unwholsom too, it were too rich else; and
to all this contempt of what she do's I can laugh at her tears, neglect
her angers, hear her without a faith, so pity her as if she were a
Traytour, moan her person, but deadly hate her pride; if you could do
these, and had but this discretion, and like fortune, it were but an
equal venture.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> This is malice.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> When she lies with your land, and not with you, grows great
with joyntures, and is brought to bed with all the state you have,
you'le find this certain; but is it come to pass you must marry, is
there no buff will hold you?
</p>
<p>
<i>Bel.</i> Grant it be so.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Then chuse the tamer evil, take a maid, a maid not worth a
penny; make her yours, knead her, and mould her yours, a maid worth
nothing, there's a vertuous spell in that
<span class="pagenum">[p 159]</span>
word nothing; a maid makes
conscience of half a Crown a week for pins and puppits, a maid will be
content with one Coach and two Horses, not falling out because they are
not matches; with one man satisfied, with one rein guided, with one
faith, one content, one bed, aged she makes the wise, preserves the fame
and issue; a widow is a Christmas-box that sweeps all.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fount.</i> Yet all this cannot sink us.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> You are my friends, and all my loving friends, I spend your
mony, yet I deserve it too, you are my friends still, I ride your
horses, when I want I sell 'em; I eat your meat, help to wear her
linnen, sometimes I make you drunk, and then you seal, for which I'le do
you this commodity, be ruled, and let me try her, I will discover her,
the truth is, I will never leave to trouble her, till I see through her,
then if I find her worthy.
</p>
<p>
<i>Hare.</i> This was our meaning <i>Valentine</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> 'Tis done then, I must want nothing.
</p>
<p>
<i>Hare.</i> Nothing but the woman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> No jealousie; for when I marry, the Devil must be wiser than I
ake him; and the flesh foolisher: come let's to dinner, and when I am
well whetted with wine, have at her.<span class="stage">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span>

</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Yes, <i>Shorthose</i> told me so.
</p>

<p>
<i>Isab.</i> How is he a man, and no man?
</p>
<p>
<i>Short.</i> He's a begger, only the sign of a man, the bush pull'd
down, which shows the house stands emptie.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> What's his calling?

<p>
<i>Short.</i> They call him begger.

<p>
<i>Short.</i> Beggers.

can tell what foolish people call him.

<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Short.</i> O that fool, he lies in loose sheets every where, that's
no where.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> You have glean'd since you came to <i>London</i>: in the
Country, <i>Shorthose</i>, you were an arrant fool, a dull cold
coxcombe, here every Tavern teaches you, the pint pot has so belaboured
you with wit, your brave acquaintance that gives you Ale, so fortified
your mazard, that now there's no talking to you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> 'Is much improved, a fellow, a fine discourser.
</p>
<p>
<i>Short.</i> I hope so, I have not waited at the tail of wit so long to
be an Ass.
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> But say now, <i>Shorthose</i>, my Lady should remove into
the Country.

would undertake to follow her.

such-a-one, to meet at the Rose, and bring my Lady, such-a-ones chief
Chamber-maid.

<i>Shorthose</i>, nor down o'th' knees to that illustrious Lady.

and wonder at, till thou beest oyl, and then come home again, and lye
byth' Legend.

an Ass, lie plodding, and lie fooling, about this Blazing Star, and that

<p>
<i>Isab.</i> I am in love sweet <i>Luce</i>, and you are so skilfull,
that I must needs undo my self; and hear me, let <i>Oliver</i> pack up
my Glass discreetly, and see my Curles well carried. O sweet
<i>Luce</i>, you have a tongue, and open tongues have open you know
what, <i>Luce.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Luce.</i> Pray you be satisfied.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> Yes and contented too, before I leave you: there's a
<i>Roger</i>, which some call a Butcher, I speak of certainties, I do
not fish <i>Luce</i>, nay do not stare, I have a tongue can talk too:
and a Green Chamber <i>Luce</i>, a back door opens to a long Gallerie;
there was a night <i>Luce</i>, do you perceive, do you perceive me yet?
O do you blush <i>Luce</i>? a Friday night I saw your Saint, <i>Luce</i>:

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> As you have made my sister jealous of me, and foolishly,
and childishly pursued it, I have found out your haunt, and traced your

And understand it well, you must not think your sister so tender eyed as
not to see your follies, alas I know your heart, and must imagine, and
truly too; 'tis not your charitie can coin such sums to give away as you
have done, in that you have no wisdom <i>Isabel</i>, no nor modesty,
where nobler uses are at home; I tell you, I am ashamed to find this in
your years, far more in your discretion, none to chuse but things for
pity, none to seal your thoughts on, but one of no abiding, of no name;
nothing to bring you to but this, cold and hunger: A jolly Joynture

shall eat his next meal, take his rest, unless it be i'th' stocks; what
kindred has he, but a more wanting Brother, or what vertues.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> You have had rare intelligence, I see, sister.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Or say the man had vertue, is vertue in this age a full
inheritance? what Joynture can he make you, <i>Plutarchs Morals</i>, or
so much penny rent in the small Poets? this is not well, 'tis weak, and
I grieve to know it.

<i>Isab.</i> You are better read in my affairs than I am, that's all I
have to answer, I'le go with you, and willingly, and what you think most
dangerous, I'le sit laugh at. For sister 'tis not folly but good
discretion governs our main fortunes.

<p>
<i>Wid.</i> I pray tell me, who sent you hither? for I imagine it is not
your condition, you look so temperately, and like a Gentleman, to ask
me these milde questions.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Do you think I use to walk of errands, gentle Lady, or deal
with women out of dreams from others?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You have not know[n] me sure?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Not much.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> What reason have you then to be so tender of my credit, you
are no kinsman?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> If you take it so, the honest office that I came to do you,
is not so heavy but I can return it: now I perceive you are too proud,
not worth my visit.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Pray stay, a little proud.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Monstrous proud, I griev'd to hear a woman of your value,
and your abundant parts stung by the people, but now I see 'tis true,
you look upon me as if I were a rude and saucie fellow that borrowed all
my breeding from a dunghil, or such a one, as should now fall and
worship you in hope of pardon: you are cozen'd Lady, I came to prove
opinion a loud liar, to see a woman only great in goodness, and Mistress
of a greater fame than fortune, but&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You are a strange Gentleman, if I were proud now, I should be
monstrous angry, which I am not, and shew the effects of pride; I should
despise you, but you are welcom Sir: To think well of our selves, if we
deserve it, it is a lustre in us, and every good we have, strives to
shew gracious, what use is it else? old age like Seer-trees, is seldom
seen affected, stirs sometimes at rehearsal of such acts as his daring
youth endeavour'd.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> This is well, and now you speak to the purpose, you please
me, but to be place proud?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> If it be our own, why are we set here with distinction else,
degrees, and orders given us? In you men, 'tis held a coolness, if you
lose your right, affronts and loss of honour: streets, and walls, and
upper ends of tables, had they tongues could tell what blood has
followed, and what feud about your ranks; are we so much below you, that
till you have us, are the tops of nature, to be accounted drones without
a difference? you will make us beasts indeed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Nay worse than this too, proud of your cloaths, they
<span class="pagenum">[p 172]</span>
swear
a Mercers Lucifer, a tumour tackt together by a Taylour, nay yet worse,
proud of red and white, a varnish that butter-milk can better.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Lord, how little will vex these poor blind people! if my
cloaths be sometimes gay and glorious, does it follow, my mind must be
my Mercers too? or say my beauty please some weak eyes, must it please
them to think, that blows me up, that every hour blows off? this is an
Infants anger.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Thus they say too, what though you have a Coach lined
through with velvet, and four fair <i>Flanders</i> mares, why should the
streets be troubled continually with you, till Carmen curse you? can
there be ought in this but pride of shew Lady, and pride of bum-beating,
till the learned lawyers with their fat bags, are thrust against the
bulks till all their causes crack? why should this Lady, and t'other
Lady, and the third sweet Lady, and Madam at <i>Mile-end</i>, be daily
visited, and your poorer neighbours, with course napfes neglected,
fashions conferr'd about, pouncings, and paintings, and young mens
bodies read on like Anatomies.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You are very credulous, and somewhat desperate, to deliver
this Sir, to her you know not, but you shall confess me, and find I will
not start; in us all meetings lie open to these lewd reports, and our
thoughts at Church, our very meditations some will swear, which all
should fear to judge, at least uncharitably, are mingled with your
memories, cannot sleep, but this sweet Gentleman swims in our fancies,
that scarlet man of war, and that smooth senior; not dress our heads
without new ambushes, how to surprize that greatness, or that glorie;
our very smiles are subject to constructions; nay Sir, it's come to this
we cannot pish, but 'tis a favour for some fool or other: should we
examine you thus, wer't not possible to take you without Perspectives?
</p>
<p>
[<i>Val.</i>] It may be, but these excuse not.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Nor yours force no truth Sir, what deadly tongues you have,
and to those tongues what hearts, and what inventions? O' my conscience,
and 'twere not for sharp justice, you would venture to aim at your own
mothers, and account it glorie to say you had done so: all you think are
counsels, and cannot erre, 'tis we still that shew double, giddy, or
gorg'd with passion; we that build Babels for mens conclusions, we
<span class="pagenum">[p 173]</span>
that scatter, as day does his warm light; our killing curses over Gods
creatures, next to the devils malice: lets intreat your good words.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Well, this woman has a brave soul.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Are not we gaily blest then, and much beholding to you for
your substance? you may do what you list, we what beseems us, and
narrowly do that too, and precisely, our names are served in else at
Ordinaries, and belcht abroad in Taverns.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> O most brave Wench, and able to redeem an age of women.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You are no Whoremasters? Alas, no, Gentlemen, it were an
impudence to think you vicious: you are so holy, handsome Ladies fright
you, you are the cool things of the time, the temperance, meer Emblems
of the Law, and veils of Vertue, you are not daily mending like Dutch
Watches, and plastering like old Walls; they are not Gentlemen, that
with their secret sins increase our Surgeons, and lie in Foraign
Countries, for new sores; Women are all these Vices; you are not
envious, false, covetous, vain-glorious, irreligious, drunken,
revengeful, giddie-eyed like Parrots, eaters of others honours.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> You are angry.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> No by my troth, and yet I could say more too, for when men
make me angry, I am miserable.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Sure 'tis a man, she could not bear it thus bravely else, it
may be I am tedious.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Not at all, Sir, I am content at this time you should
trouble me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> You are distrustful.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Where I find no truth, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Come, come, you are full of passion.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Some I have, I were too near the nature o' God else.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> You are monstrous peevish.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Because they are monstrous foolish, and know not how to use
that should try me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I was never answered thus; were you never drunk Lady?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> No sure, not drunk, Sir; yet I love good Wine, as I love
health and joy of heart, but temperately, why do you ask that question?
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 174]</span>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> For that sin that they most charge you with, is this sin's
servant, they say you are monstrous&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> What, Sir, what?
</p>
<p>
<i>Pal.</i> Most strangely.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> It has a name sure?
</p>
<p>
<i>Pal.</i> Infinitely lustful, without all bounds, they swear you
kill'd your Husband.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Let us have it all for Heavens sake, 'tis good mirth, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> They say you will have four now, and those four stuck in
four quarters, like four winds to cool you: will she not cry nor curse?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> On with your story.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> And that you are forcing out of dispensations with sums of
money to that purpose.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Four Husbands! should not I be blest, Sir, for example?
Lord, what should I do with them? turn a Malt-mill, or Tithe them out
like Town-bulls to my Tenants, you come to make me angry, but you
cannot.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I'le make you merry then, you are a brave Woman, and in
despite of envy a right one, go thy wayes, truth thou art as good a
Woman, as any Lord of them all can lay his Leg over, I do not often
commend your Sex.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> It seems so, your commendations are so studied for.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I came to see you and sift you into Flowr to know your
pureness, and I have found you excellent, I thank you; continue so, and
shew men how to tread, and women how to follow: get an Husband, an
honest man, you are a good woman, and live hedg'd in from scandal, let
him be too an understanding man, and to that stedfast; 'tis pity your
fair Figure should miscarry, and then [you] are fixt: farewel.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Pray stay a little, I love your company now you are so
pleasant, and to my disposition set so even.

flouted, and shown to Chambermaids, like a strange beast, she had
purchased with her penny.

<i>Lan.</i> You Lady, or your fair Sister there, here's a Gentleman that
has received a benefit.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> From whom, Sir?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> From one of you, as he supposes, Madam, your man delivered
it.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> And of so great a goodness, that he dares not, without the
tender of his thanks and service, pass by the house.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> This, Madam.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> What's your name, Sir?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> They that know me call me <i>Francisco</i>, Lady, one not
so proud to scorn so timely a benefit, nor so wretched to hide a
gratitude.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> It is well bestowed then.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Your fair self, or your Sister as it seems, for what desert
I dare not know, unless a handsome subject for your charities, or
aptness in your noble will to do it, have showred upon my wants a timely
bounty, which makes me rich in thanks, my best inheritance.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> I am sorry 'twas not mine, this is the Gentlewoman, fie, do
not blush, go roundly to the matter, the man is a pretty man.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> You have three fine ones.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Then to you, dear Lady?
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> I pray no more, Sir, if I may perswade you, your only
aptness to do this is recompence, and more than I expected.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> But good Lady.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> And for me further to be acquainted with it besides the
imputation of vain glory, were greedy thankings of my self, I did it not
to be more affected to; I did it, and if it happened where I thought it
fitted, I have my end; more to enquire is curious in either of us, more
than that suspicious.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> But gentle Lady, 'twill be necessary.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> About the right way nothing, do not fright it, being to
pious use and tender sighted, with the blown face of Complements, it
blasts it; had you not come at all, but thought thanks, it had been too
much, 'twas not to see your person.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 189]</span>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> A brave dissembling Rogue, and how she carries it!
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> Though I believe few handsomer; or hear you, though I affect
a good tongue well; or try you, though my years desire a friend, that I
relieved you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> A plaguie cunning quean.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> For so I carried it, my end's too glorious in mine eyes,
and bettered the goodness I propounded with opinion.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Fear her not, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> You cannot catch me, Sister.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Will you both teach, and tie my tongue up Lady?
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> Let it suffice you have it, it was never mine, whilest good
men wanted it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lan.</i> This is a Saint sure.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> And if you be not such a one, restore it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> To commend my self, were more officious than you think my
thanks are, to doubt I may be worth your gift a treason, both to mine
own good and understanding, I know my mind clear, and though modesty
tells me, he that intreats intrudes; yet I must think something, and of
some season, met with your better taste, this had not been else.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> What ward for that, wench?
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> Alas, it never touched me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Well, gentle Lady, yours is the first money I ever took
upon a forced ill manners.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> The last of me, if ever you use other.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> How may I do, and your way to be thought a grateful taker?
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> Spend it, and say nothing, your modesty may deserve more.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> O Sister will you bar thankfulness?
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> Dogs dance for meat, would ye have men do worse? for they
can speak, cry out like Wood-mongers, good deeds by the hundreds, I did
it that my best friend should not know it, wine and vain glory does as
much as I else, if you will force my merit, against my meaning, use it
in well bestowing it, in shewing it came to be a benefit, and was so;
and not examining a Woman did it, or to what end, in not believing
sometimes your self, when drink and stirring conversation may ripen
strange perswasions.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fran.</i> Gentle Lady, I were a base receiver of a courtesie,
<span class="pagenum">[p 190]</span>
and you a worse disposer, were my nature unfurnished of these fore-sights.
Ladies honours were ever in my thoughts, unspotted Crimes, their good
deeds holy Temples, where the incense burns not; to common eyes your
fears are vertuous, and so I shall preserve 'em.
</p>
<p>
<i>Isa.</i> Keep but this way, and from this place to tell me so, you
have paid me; and so I wish you see all fortune.               <span class="stage">[<i>Exit.</i></span>

you so crafty, carry it so precisely? this is to wake my fears, or to
abuse me, I shall look narrowly: despair not Gentlemen, there is an hour
to catch a Woman in, if you be wise, so, I must leave you too; Now will
I go laugh at my Suitors.                                      <span class="stage">[<i>Exit.</i></span>

me she has an itch, but how to make her confess it, for it is a crafty
Tit, and plays about you, will not bite home, she would fain, but she

the hands of Fencers, Challengers, Tooth-drawers Bills, and tedious
Proclamations in Meal-markets, with throngings to see Cutpurses: stir
not, but hear, and mark, I'le cut your throats else, till Water works,
and rumours of New Rivers rid you again and run you into questions who
built Thames, till you run mad for Lotteries, and stand there with your
Tables to glean the golden Sentences, and cite 'em secre[t]ly to
Servingmen for sound Essayes, till Taverns allow you but a Towel room to
Tipple Wine in, that the Bell hath gone for twice, and Glasses that look
like broken promises, tied up with wicker protestations, English Tobacco
with half Pipes, nor in half a year once burnt, and Bisket that Bawds

<i>Wid.</i> Because I said in jest once, you were a handsom man, one I
could like well, and fooling, made you believe I loved you, and might be
brought to marrie.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> The widow is drunk too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You out of this, which is a fine discretion, give out the
matter's done, you have won and wed me, and that you have put, fairly
put for an heir too, these are fine rumours to advance my credit: i'th'
name of mischief what did you mean?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> That you loved me, and that you might be brought to marrie
me? why, what a Devil do you mean, widow?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> 'Twas a fine trick too, to tell the world though you had
enjoyed your first wish you wished, the wealth you aimed at, that I was
poor, which is most true, I am, have sold my lands, because I love not
those vexations, yet for mine honours sake, if you must be prating, and
for my credits sake in the Town.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> I tell thee widow, I like thee ten times better, now thou
hast no Lands, for now thy hopes and cares lye on thy husband, if e're
thou marryest more.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Have not you married me, and for this main cause, now as you
report it, to be your Nurse?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> My Nurse? why, what am I grown to, give me the Glass, my
Nurse.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You n'er said truer, I must confess I did a little favour
you, and with some labour might have been perswaded, but when I found I
must be hourly troubled, with making broths, and dawbing your decayes
with swadling, and with stitching up your ruines, for the world so
reports.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Do not provoke me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> And half an eye may see.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Do not provoke me, the world's a lying world, and thou shalt
find it, have a good heart, and take a strong faith to thee, and mark
what follows, my Nurse, yes, you shall rock me: Widow I'le keep you
waking.
</p>
<span class="pagenum">[p 205]</span>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> You are disposed Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Yes marry am I Widow, and you shall feel it, nay and they
touch my freehold, I am a Tiger.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> I think so.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Come.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> Whither?
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Any whither.                                         <span class="stage">[<i>Sings.</i></span>

  Let the Cobler meddle with his tools,<br>
  The fit's upon me now.<br>
</p>
<p>
Take me quickly, while I am in this vein, away with me, for if I have
but two hours to consider, all the widows in the world cannot recover
me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wid.</i> If you will, go with me Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Val.</i> Yes marrie will I, but 'tis in anger yet, and I will marrie
thee, do not cross me; yes, and I will lie with thee, and get a whole
bundle of babies, and I will kiss thee, stand still and kiss me
handsomely, but do not provoke me, stir neither hand nor foot, for I am
dangerous, I drunk sack yesternight, do not allure me: Thou art no widow
of this world, come in pitie, and in spite I'le marrie thee, not a word

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
